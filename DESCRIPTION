Description: An implementation of robust boosting algorithms for regression in R. This includes the RRBoost method proposed in the paper "Robust Boosting for Regression Problems, Computational Statistics and Data Science  (2020, In Press);. https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02054. It also implements other robust boosting methods (L2Boost, LADBoost, MBoost, and Robloss) included in the simulation section of the paper.
