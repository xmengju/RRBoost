\item{type}{type of the boosting method: "L2Boost", "LADBoost", "MBoost", "Robloss", "SBoost", "RRBoost" (character string)}

\item{error}{a character string (or vector of character strings) indicating the type of error metrics to be evaluated on the test set. Valid options are: "rmse" (root mean squared error), "aad" (average absolute deviation), and "trmse" (trimmed root mean squared error)}

\description{
This function implements the RRBoost robust boosting algorithm for regression,
as well as other robust and non-robust boosting algorithms for regression.
}
\details{
This function implements a robust boosting algorithm for regression (RRBoost).
It  also includes the following robust and non-robust boosting algorithms
for regression: L2Boost, LADBoost, MBoost, Robloss, and SBoost. This function
uses the functions available in the \code{rpart} package to construct binary regression trees.
